This script provides two functions to backup and encrypt a directory, and to decrypt and restore a previously backed up directory.
The script takes command-line arguments to specify the directory to backup or restore, and the encryption key to use.

The backup_and_encrypt function creates a backup directory with the suffix .backup appended to the original directory name. 
It then copies the contents of the original directory to the backup directory.
A new key is generated and saved to a file in the backup directory. 
All files in the backup directory are encrypted using the key.

The decrypt_and_restore function reads the key from the file in the backup directory and decrypts all files in the backup directory using the key. 
The function then restores the backup directory to a new directory with the suffix .restore appended to the original directory name.

The script uses the argparse module in Python to parse command-line arguments. 
The script takes two required arguments: the directory to backup or restore, and the encryption key. 
It also takes an optional flag -d or --decrypt to specify if the script should restore from a backup.

Overall, this script provides a simple and secure way to backup and restore a directory with encryption.
